# Solana Account

### 💡 On Solana, everything is an account

* Wallet = account
* Token = token account = ATA = [Associated Token Account](ata-account.md)
* NFT = account
* Even a program (smart contract) is an account!

➡️ Each account can store data.



### Each Account takes resources

Every account (wallet, token, NFT…) uses RAM.&#x20;

➡️ You pay rent to keep it alive — even if the token balance is 0.



🎯 Solution: SweepSOL auto-closes unused token accounts (ATAs).
